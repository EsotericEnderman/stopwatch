# ‚è∞ Stopwatch

A simple stopwatch project made using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `JS`. This was part of the [JS course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBmSRK3feww) by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev) that I took to learn `JS`, `HTML`, and `CSS` together.

## Features

- Start/stop button
